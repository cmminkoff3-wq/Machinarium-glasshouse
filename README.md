# Machinarium-glasshouse
This Python code mimics the lightbox puzzle from the video game Machinarium by Amanita Design, with a few modifications and additions. This was made completely from scratch and without AI, so don't be surprised if there are mistakes. As always, I would love to hear how to improve it!
